👋 Hi, I'm Reza Rohani (@theonlykingpin)!
I'm a passionate backend developer with over 3 years of experience crafting robust, scalable, and high-performance applications. My focus lies in leveraging Python, Go, Rust, and Zig to build efficient backend solutions that power seamless user experiences. I thrive on solving complex problems, writing clean code, and exploring cutting-edge technologies.

🚀 What I Do

🛠️ Build scalable APIs and microservices using Django, Django REST Framework, and FastAPI.  
🗄️ Design and optimize databases with SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB).  
⚡ Experiment with low-level programming in Rust and Zig for performance-critical systems.  
🧰 Utilize tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and message queues to streamline development and deployment.  
💻 Contribute to open-source projects and share knowledge through my backend roadmap and blog.
